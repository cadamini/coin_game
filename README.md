# coin_game
This is a little test project to solve a geocaching mystery
and to practise programming and writing specs.

Gameflow: 
* Each coin is lying upside-down at the beginning. 
* In the first round each coin is flipped-over.
* In each subsequent round one more coin is skipped, 
  - 2nd round -> every 2nd coin
  - 3rd round -> ever 3rd coin
  - and so on ...

Run ruby start_game.rb 256 to start the game.

Enjoy!
